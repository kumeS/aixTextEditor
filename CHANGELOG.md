# Changelog

## v1.0.0 — 2026-06-21

First public release.

### Editing
- Chunk-based editor (text / heading / diagram / image chunks).
- **Multiple tabs** — manage several documents at once; each tab keeps its own
  document, file, undo/redo history and relationship graph (`⌘/Ctrl+T`, tab-bar ＋).
- **Headings** — `#`/`##`/`###` become heading chunks (levels 1–3); type the
  marker at a paragraph's start to convert.
- Split / merge / reorder chunks; move between chunks with the Up/Down arrows.

### AI (OpenRouter)
- Per-chunk ✨ menu: Translate, Proofread (selectable style), Expand, Add detail,
  Concentrate, Focus, Summarize, Generate diagram, Custom instruction.
- **Draft** — generate a structured document from a theme, streamed into a new
  tab in real time.
- **Image generation** — per paragraph or from a multi-paragraph selection;
  inserted as movable image chunks. Uses a separately-configured image model.
- **Relationship graph** — paragraph + per-sentence nodes with typed relations,
  rendered with Cytoscape; persisted in the `.aix` file.
- Context-aware prompts (neighbouring paragraphs); automatic retry/back-off on
  rate limits (HTTP 429).

### Files & platform
- Native `.aix` save/open (lossless); merged **Import / Export** menu for
  `.txt` / `.md` / `.rtf`.
- Native application menu mirrors the in-app toolbar.
- API key stored in the OS keychain; all network calls happen in Rust.
